iminuit
========

iminuit is a python (espcially ) friendly
wrapper of `lcg-minuit`_ . The most popular minimizer used in High Energy
Physics which has been around for more than 40 years(for a good reason).

iminuit is  designed from ground up to be used in an interactive fitting environment
taking full advantage of `IPython notebook <ipythonnb>`_.
To make transition from the popular `PyMinuit`_ easy, RTMinuit is (mostly)
compatible with PyMinuit (just change the import statement).
